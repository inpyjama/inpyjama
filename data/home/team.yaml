  text1: "We are a bunch of Embedded Systems Engineers with a decade of experience working in the Semiconductor Industry.

  We have had the good fortune of witnessing the entire Embedded systems development journey - From SoCs design to running Linux on it. Right from **BootRom** to the **Linux Kernel Drivers** (and beyond) development - **We have seen it all!**

  We precisely know what works and what doesn't, which skills are useful and which just feel useful... **inPyjama** is our effort to lowering the barrier to learning Embedded Systems and help learners focus on what really matters in the Industry and in real life!"
