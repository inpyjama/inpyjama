  title: "Learning **Embedded** Systems!"
  text: "We at inpyjama are on a mission to lowering ’the barrier’ to learning Embedded Systems. With almost a decade of experience working on lower level software (and hardware) deployed on Embedded Systems, we have insights into what works, what doesn’t and how to deal with the complex systems.\n\n
  **There is a way to look at things**. Once you know that - the complexity disappears! We intend to teach such insights so you can excel at Embedded Software Engineering.\n\n
  We started off with writing a book (**C Ninja, in Pyjama!**) that guides the reader from very basics of how CPUs work to outputting **\"Hello, world\"** on the UART. While the book is still a work in progress, the public draft is available for a read.\n\n
  Writing a book takes a lot of effort, so, we decided to also release pre-recorded courses to share everything we know about Embedded Systems Software Engineering."
